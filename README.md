## Workflow Templates (GitHub Actions)

Following the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/sharing-workflows-with-your-organization#creating-a-workflow-template) this repo contains several useful templates for actions we use across all repos at Kamma. For things such as; PHPUnit, Pushing to ECR, etc.

Check out the `./workflow-templates` directory for all of the available templates. GitHub should recommend their usage if the `filePatterns` are set correctly.
